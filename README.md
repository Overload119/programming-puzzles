programming-puzzles
===================

A list of technical interview questions I've come across and have been inclined to complete for practice.

All the work here was done solely by me and in a "interview"[0] environment, and as such the solutions may be slow or not written in the best way but they all work.

For most of the answers, I put the question in comments.

Question are from 
- [careercup.com]()
- [projecteuler.com]()

[0] No searching the internet for solutions, no "trying" out the code (except when my solution was done), no requests for assistance in anyway.
